Large field multiplayer mine sweeper


Ideas:
1. Create a private board where people can be invited to (to be determined: max board size, max player size)
2. Create a public board which people can see and join (to be determined: max board size, max player size)
3. Create general board. No player limit, fixed size, auto archive and create new board after 80%(???) completion
